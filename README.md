# AmazoniaHack-Ibama-Fiscalizators

Using Python, SQL and JavaScript, the project give a interface to upload and process images took during Ibama's operations and visualize them on a interactive map.

### Challenge Statement
The challenge is to develop an automated solution that creates a comprehensive georeferenced database and map system for timestamped data in Brazil. This system must seamlessly integrate with the existing item stamp app used by two distinct user groups - Guards and IBAMA's management teams. The primary objective is to enable users to easily upload, visualize, and analyze both historical and new timestamped data on a map of Brazil, while also efficiently tracking the user types responsible for capturing photos and videos. The solution should be inherently flexible to accommodate future expansion and integration with additional data sources, such as Planet images and mapbiomas data. 

Currently, IBAMA inspectors use the TimeStamp app to register their visits to the field, however this app does not allow an automatic viewing of the areas' data history and the data geolocation map. For this project, you will have access to this sample to use as part of your solution development.

*Suggested Goals*:
- Create a fully functioning prototype of a geolocated map
- Develop comprehensive wireframes for the app, offering a clear visual blueprint for its design and functionality
- Implement basic upload/download functionality within the app
